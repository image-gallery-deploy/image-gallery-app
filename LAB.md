===

For this assignment, build three different display components for an image url: 
 1. The first should display the title of the image, the link (not the  actual image), and short description.  
 1. The second should display the image as a "thumbnail" (within a 100x100 pixel scale). 
 1. The third should display the title, the full-size image, and the description. 

You can use your own URL, or work with this cute bunny: http://f.cl.ly/items/3g3J1G0w122M360w380O/3726490195_f7cc75d377_o.jpg 

Create a high-level component that loads all three different components for a 
single hard-coded url (feel free to put into a service), to demonstrate the distinctions between each display mode.

Create an app component that hosts the high-level component.

BONUS:
* Have the high-level component take a "parameter" to toggle between the display modes.
