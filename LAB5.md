===

The cuteness is growing! Your app needs to be able to handle multiple albums. Maybe like Cute Kittens!

Your app needs to be navigable via linking that utilizes the UI router to change the app state.

You can either:
* Have a list of albums that changes a nested view to the images of the currently selected album (master/detail), or
* Have a view with list of albums that changes that view to the list of currently selected images
(make sure you provide a way to go back to albums page)

* User should be able to add new albums as well as add new images to selected albums
* Toggling between "detail", "thumbnail" and "gallery" view should still work
